The code iterates over all the form-control labels in the document and sets their innerHTML to be the label's text.
It then iterates through each letter of that string, creating a span with a transition delay of 50ms for each letter.
The span is joined together into one string which is set as the label's innerText.
The code splits the text of each label and creates a span tag with an animation delay.
