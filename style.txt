The code starts with the body tag. The background color is set to steelblue, and the text color is set to #fff. There are two flex-direction properties: column and row. The align-items property centers all of the items in a container, while justify-content centers them vertically within that container. The .container h1 tag has a margin bottom of 30px, and it's centered horizontally on the page with text-align: center. It also has an overflow hidden so that content doesn't spill out from under it when there isn't enough room for everything inside of it (like in this case). There are three buttons on this page: one button with no border radius at all; another button with a 5 pixel border radius; and finally, one button which has been scaled down by 0.98 times its original size because it was active when clicked on by the user (the transform property).
The code is a CSS snippet that will be applied to the body of the HTML document. The code is used to set a background color, font family, and text alignment. The CSS snippet above also contains some basic styling for buttons and input fields.
